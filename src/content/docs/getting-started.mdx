# Getting Started with Polyseal

Welcome to Polyseal, a production-ready Web3 toolkit for reading and verifying EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) attestations on Polygon Amoy testnet.

## Quick Start

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

To get started with Polyseal, you'll need a Web3 wallet that supports Polygon networks:

1. **Install a Wallet**: We recommend [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), or [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) compatible wallets.

2. **Connect to Polyseal**: Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner of any page.

3. **Approve Connection**: Your wallet will prompt you to connect to Polyseal. Click "Connect" to proceed.

### 2. Switch to Polygon Amoy

Polyseal operates on the Polygon Amoy testnet (Chain ID: 80002). If you're on a different network:

1. **Network Banner**: You'll see a yellow banner prompting you to switch networks.
2. **One-Click Switch**: Click "Switch to Amoy" to automatically add and switch to the correct network.
3. **Manual Setup**: If automatic switching fails, add Amoy manually with these details:

```
Network Name: Polygon Amoy
RPC URL: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
Chain ID: 80002
Symbol: POL
Explorer: https://amoy.polygonscan.com
```

### 3. Try an Example Attestation

Once connected, try looking up an example attestation:

1. **Go to Attestations**: Navigate to [/attestations](/attestations)
2. **Enter Example UID**: Try this sample attestation UID:
   ```
   0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
   ```
3. **View Results**: See the attestation data, schema information, and verification details.

## Understanding Attestations

An **attestation** is a signed statement about something, stored on the blockchain. Each attestation contains:

- **UID**: Unique identifier (32-byte hash)
- **Schema**: Structure definition for the data
- **Attester**: Address that created the attestation
- **Recipient**: Address the attestation is about (can be zero address)
- **Data**: The actual attestation content (encoded)
- **Timestamp**: When it was created
- **Expiration**: When it expires (if applicable)
- **Revocable**: Whether it can be revoked

## EAS Integration

Polyseal integrates with the Ethereum Attestation Service:

- **EAS Contract**: `0xb101275a60d8bfb14529C421899aD7CA1Ae5B5Fc`
- **Schema Registry**: `0x23c5701A1BDa89C61d181BD79E5203c730708AE7`
- **Polyseal Schema**: `0x27d06e3659317e9a4f8154d1e849eb53d43d91fb4f219884d1684f86d797804a`
